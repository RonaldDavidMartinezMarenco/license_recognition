Columna	Descripción
epoch	:Número de época (ciclo de entrenamiento completo sobre los datos).
time	:Tiempo acumulado en segundos desde que comenzó el entrenamiento.
train/box_loss	:Pérdida de bounding boxes (cajas delimitadoras), mide qué tan bien se ajustan los cuadros a los objetos reales.
train/cls_loss	:Pérdida de clasificación, mide qué tan bien el modelo asigna la clase correcta a cada objeto detectado.
train/dfl_loss	:Pérdida de distribución de frontera (DFL), optimiza la precisión de los bordes de las cajas.
metrics/precision(B)	:Precisión en validación, mide qué porcentaje de predicciones fueron correctas (TP / (TP + FP)).
metrics/recall(B)	:Recall en validación, mide qué porcentaje de objetos fueron detectados correctamente (TP / (TP + FN)).
metrics/mAP50(B)	:Media de precisión (mAP) con un umbral de IoU de 0.50, mide qué tan bien se detectan los objetos.
metrics/mAP50-95(B)	:mAP en múltiples umbrales (de 0.50 a 0.95), refleja la calidad general de la detección.
val/box_loss	:Pérdida de cajas en validación, mide qué tan bien se ajustan las cajas en los datos de prueba.
val/cls_loss	:Pérdida de clasificación en validación, indica si el modelo clasifica bien los objetos en validación.
val/dfl_loss	:Pérdida DFL en validación, mide precisión de los bordes en los datos de prueba.
lr/pg0, lr/pg1, lr/pg2	:Tasas de aprendizaje de diferentes grupos de parámetros, indican con qué rapidez se ajusta el modelo.
